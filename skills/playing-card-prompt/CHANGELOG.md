# Changelog — playing-card-prompt

All notable changes to this skill. Released per skill as tag
`playing-card-prompt/v<version>`. The version in `SKILL.md` frontmatter
(`metadata.version`) is the source of truth.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `scripts/manage_config.py` — dependency-free CLI to read/write/validate `config.json` (`show`, `get`, `set`, `unset`, `validate`, `reset`, `options`, `path`); validates `deck`/`style` against the files in `assets/` and enforces the index/lettering/aspect enums

### Changed
- Trimmed the config section of SKILL.md — removed lookup-order/schema/field tables already covered in `references/CONFIG.md`, leaving only short pointers and the per-mode CLI commands
