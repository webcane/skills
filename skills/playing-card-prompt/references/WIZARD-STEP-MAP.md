# Wizard Step Map

## Wizard steps: components × layers × placeholders × assets

Maps each wizard step (see `SKILL.md`) to the style components from
`STYLE-COMPONENTS.md` (by number), the `layers.*` it configures (see
`REFERENCE.md`), the prompt placeholders it feeds, and the `assets/` files it
loads.

| # | Step | Components (STYLE-COMPONENTS.md) | Layers (`layers.*`) | Placeholders | Assets |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Deck type | #12 Pip/suit symbol design (deck's suits) | — | — (loads the suit/rank table) | `assets/decks/<deck>.md` |
| **2** | Court lettering | #13 Typography / indices | Index *(structural — rank letters)* | `RANK_LETTER` (for court/ace) | `assets/lettering/systems.md` |
| **3** | Rank | — *(template choice, not a style component)* | Center motif *(structural — selects COURT/PIP/ACE/JOKER)*; sets this card's group (`court`/`pip`/`ace`/`joker`), which determines the `layers.figure.<group>` default checked after Step 7 | `RANK_NAME`, `RANK_LETTER` | `references/REFERENCE.md` (rank table), `assets/courts/<rank>.md` if court or joker |
| **4** | Suit *(skipped for Joker)* | #12 Pip/suit symbol design | Center motif *(structural)* | `SUIT_NAME_TITLE`, `SUIT_NAME`, `SUIT_SYMBOL`, `SUIT_COLOR` | `assets/decks/<deck>.md` |
| **4.1** | Joker role *(Joker only, per-card)* | #2 Color palette | Center motif *(structural)* | `JOKER_ROLE` | — |
| **4.2** | Joker index glyph *(Joker only, persistent)* | #13 Typography / indices | Index *(structural)* | `JOKER_INDEX` → feeds `[INDEX_LINE]` | — |

| **B6** | Back frame *(Back only, persistent)* | — | Frame (`layers.frame.back`) | — (sets `layers.frame.back`) | — |
| **B7** | Back exclusions *(Back only, per-card, optional)* | — *(negative constraints)* | — | `NEGATIVE_LIST` | — |
| **S1** | Card title *(Special only, per-card)* | — *(structural)* | — | `CARD_NAME` | — |
| **S2** | Special card type *(Special only, per-card)* | #5 Composition/rhythm | — | `SPECIAL_TYPE_LINE` | `assets/special/*.md` (excluding `_*`) |
| **S3** | Visual content description *(Special only, per-card, optional for prospect)* | #9 Poses/gestures, #10 Costume/accessories | Center motif | `FIGURE_DESCRIPTION` (partial), `SPECIAL_ATTRIBUTES` | — |
| **S4** | Named figure *(Special+Prospect only, per-card)* | #9 Poses/gestures | Center motif | `FIGURE_DESCRIPTION` (named figure + S3 description) | `assets/special/prospect.md` (type line only; figure name is per-card user input) |
| **S5** | Special card exclusions *(Special only, per-card, optional)* | — *(negative constraints)* | — | `NEGATIVE_LIST` | — |
| **5** | Visual style/pattern | #1 Medium/technique, #2 Color palette, #3 Era/cultural context, #6 Line character, #7 Degree of stylization *(partial)*, #11 Typage/facial expression | Background, Decor, Ornaments, Highlights, Technique, Finish, Figure detail, Face Style — supplies the TEXT for all of them | feeds `[STYLE_BLOCK]` (layer text, incl. Technique and Finish — sharing one gate — when `layers.technique.<group>` is on, and Figure detail/Face Style when `layers.figure.<group>` is on) | `assets/pattern/<style>.md`, `assets/pattern/_adding-a-pattern.md` (if custom) |
| **6** | Card decoration & theme | #14 Decoration/ornamentation, #15 Deck-wide theme/symbolism, #5 Composition/rhythm *(partial)* | Decor.pip, Ornaments.pip, Frame.pip, Highlights.\* (each toggled and given a per-group addition via `layers.<layer>.<group>`, incl. theme-derived for ornaments/highlights/frame); `layers.background`/`layers.decor` additions (config-only) | feeds `[STYLE_BLOCK]` (layer additions), `[FRAME_LINE]` (preset text + `layers.frame.<group>`'s addition) | `assets/frame/<frame>.md`, `assets/frame/_adding-a-frame.md` (if custom), `references/REFERENCE.md` ("Theme-derived ornaments/highlights/frame") |
| **7** | Mood / atmosphere | #4 Mood/atmosphere | Mood.\* (per-group toggle via `layers.mood.<group>`); `mood` (preset or custom text); `layers.mood.<group>`'s addition (config-only per-group addition) | feeds `[STYLE_BLOCK]` (`[MOOD_LINE]` + per-group addition) | `assets/mood/<name>.md`, `assets/mood/_adding-a-mood.md` (if custom) |
| **8a** | Figure scale | #5 Composition/rhythm *(figure framing/cropping — scale)* | Figure *(deck-wide `figure_scale`)* | feeds `[STYLE_BLOCK]` (figure_scale phrase, appended after character framing / non-character figure-type text) | — *(config value phrase, no asset file lookup)* |
| **8b** | Split layout | #5 Composition/rhythm *(split compositional wrapper)* | Split *(per-group `layers.split.<group>`)* | feeds `[STYLE_BLOCK]` (split phrase as outer wrapper, appended after figure_scale) | `assets/split/horizontal-mirrored.md`, `assets/split/angled-mirrored.md` |
| **Title step** | Title overlay | #5 Composition/rhythm *(deck-wide presence gate)* | — *(no `layers.*` cell — `title.enabled` is a standalone deck-wide field)* | feeds the title named element (no position/font/styling); per-card title text is ephemeral, never saved | — *(no asset file lookup)* |
| **Seamless step** | Seamless design | #5 Composition/rhythm *(seamless/connecting design across cards)* | Seamless *(per-group `layers.seamless.<group>`, court/pip/ace/joker only)* | feeds `[STYLE_BLOCK]` (seamless phrase, appended last in the figure block, after split) | `assets/seamless/continuous-border.md`, `assets/seamless/interlocking-motif.md` |
| **8c** | Figure type (`figure_type`) — gate for pattern Face Style folds into this step's own paragraph, no separate step | #5 Composition/rhythm *(figure classification)*, #11 Typage / facial expression *(character-only Face Style gate)*, #9 Poses/gestures *(partial — type preamble)* | Figure *(per-group `layers.figure.<group>` encoded value: `character`/`building`/`animal`/`custom`)* | feeds `[STYLE_BLOCK]` (figure-type preamble text; pattern's Face Style line and Figure detail when type is `character`, before character framing) | `assets/figure-type/<type>.md` (character.md, building.md, animal.md, custom.md), `assets/pattern/<style>.md` "Face Style" section |
| **8e** | Character framing *(character only)* | #5 Composition/rhythm *(character framing/cropping)* | Figure *(deck-wide `character_framing`, gated on `layers.figure.<group> = "character"`)* | feeds `[STYLE_BLOCK]` (character_framing phrase, appended after the pattern's Face Style line) | `assets/character-framing/<name>.md` |
| **9** | Character / figure description | #9 Poses/gestures (figure cards), #10 Costume/accessories (figure cards) | Center motif (portrait) | `[CHARACTER_NAME]`, `[CHARACTER_FEATURES]` | — |
| **10** | Additional/replaced attributes | #9, #10 *(figure cards only)* | Center motif (figure cards) | contributes to `[RESOLVED_ATTRIBUTES]` | `assets/courts/<rank>.md` (shows traditional attrs, court only) |
| **11** | Transfer from reference image | #9, #10, #11 *(figure cards only)* | Center motif (figure cards), Figure | overrides `[RESOLVED_ATTRIBUTES]` | — |
| **12** | Exclude from reference image | — *(negative constraints, not a style component)* | — | `[NEGATIVE_LIST]` | — |
| **13** | Aspect ratio | — *(format)* | — | `[ASPECT_RATIO]` | `references/REFERENCE.md` (aspect ratio table) |
| **14** | Image generator | — *(output post-processing)* | — *(touches all layers indirectly — reformatting)* | adapts `[NEGATIVE_LIST]`, `[ASPECT_RATIO]`, extra suffix params | `assets/engines/<engine>.md`, `assets/engines/_config.md` |

**Step 7 (Mood) always runs**, regardless of whether this card's group has a figure —
it's a persistent, deck-wide setting like Steps 1–2 and 5–6.

**Steps 8a–12 (the figure block) only run for a card whose group has
`layers.figure.<group>` set to a non-`"false"` value** (any of `character`,
`building`, `animal`, `custom`, or a custom free-text entry) — `court` and `joker`
default to `"character"`, or `pip`/`ace` can be enabled via `--config`. Otherwise
the wizard goes straight from Step 7 to Step 13. Steps 8a–8c are persistent
(asked once per group, skipped if already set in config). Step 8c's Face Style gate
(folded into 8c's own paragraph, no separate step) and Step 8e (character framing)
additionally require `layers.figure.<group> = "character"` — building/animal/custom
types skip both. Steps 9–12 are per-card.

**`structure` setting** (`full`/`illustration`, config mode item 9, persistent) — when
`illustration`, alters the opening line used in step 1's template, drops
`[INDEX_LINE]` (step 2's placeholder, normally fed by the "not covered" item below),
drops `[FRAME_LINE]` (fed by step 6) regardless of `layers.frame.<group>`, appends
a fixed block to `[NEGATIVE_LIST]` (step 12), and drops the Title step and Seamless
step entirely — neither the title named element nor the seamless phrase is added to
any STYLE_BLOCK under `illustration`, regardless of `title.enabled` /
`layers.seamless.<group>` (TITL-05/SEAM-05, one shared gate). See "`structure` setting"
in `REFERENCE.md`. All other steps/components are unaffected.

**Not covered by a dedicated step (silent / assembly-only):**
- **`[INDEX_LINE]`** — assembled from `assets/index/options.md` via silent defaults in Assembling step 2; not asked in the wizard.
- **Figure detail & Face Style** — folded into `[STYLE_BLOCK]` automatically from the chosen pattern when `layers.figure.<group>` is on; no separate wizard question or config field.
- **`layers.technique.<group>`** — on for every group by default, contributing the chosen pattern's "Technique" AND "Finish" sections (one shared gate) to `[STYLE_BLOCK]`; toggling it off per group, or setting a per-group addition (Technique only — Finish has no separate addition slot), is config-only (like `layers.background`/`layers.decor` additions), not asked in the wizard.
- **#8 Figure proportions/plasticity** (anatomical body proportions/exaggeration — distinct from the figure block's figure *framing/cropping*, see Steps 8a/8e), **#7/#9(pip,ace)/#12** — open "Partial/Not covered" gaps from STYLE-COMPONENTS.md, not addressed by any step.
- **Turning on figure for pip/ace** (`layers.figure.pip`/`.ace`) — only available via `--config`; once on, the figure block (Steps 8–12) runs for that group like court.
- **Back symmetry line** — the "Symmetry line" from `assets/back/symmetry/<back_symmetry>.md` is appended to `[STYLE_BLOCK]` automatically for the `back` group (step 10 in "Resolving `[STYLE_BLOCK]`" in `REFERENCE.md`); chosen via Step B5 (persistent).

**Joker rank group** (`rank = Joker`): Steps 4.1–4.2 (role, index placement + symbol) are documented in references/JOKER-WIZARD.md.

**Back rank group** (`rank = Back`): Steps B1–B7 run instead of Steps 4.1–4.2. B1–B6 are persistent (skipped if already set in config); B7 exclusions are per-card. Steps 4 (Suit) and 8a–12 (figure block) are skipped unless `layers.figure.back` is explicitly set to a non-false type value in config. The `back` group enters the mood check (Step 7) and the aspect ratio / generator steps (Steps 13–14) like all other groups.

**Special rank group** (`rank = Special`): Steps S1–S5 run instead of Steps 4.1–4.2 (and Step 4 suit is skipped). Steps 8a–12 (figure block) are skipped unless `layers.figure.special` is explicitly set to a non-false type value. The `special` group enters the mood check (Step 7) and the aspect ratio / generator steps (Steps 13–14) like all other groups. Step S4 (named figure) only runs for prospect-type special cards.
